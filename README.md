Virtualization tested:

####
#### About: 
When Vagrant is run, a Virtual Machine is created, it runs the Ansible playbook, which installs Apache2, PHP, MySQL and a Wordpress web app that is accessible from the LAN and a database is to be imported. 
This system will have automated Backups, so a complete restoration is done from the latest Backup after every "Vagrant up".

#### How to use:
1. Clone the repository found here: [Repository](https://github.com/Nicl0996/wordpress-ansible)
2. Make sure, Vagrant and Ansible are installed on your machine.
3. In command-line - Navigate to the Cloned repository - `cd /home/user/git/wordpress-ansible/` 
4. Start Vagrant - `vagrant up`
5. To SSH to the system - `vagrant ssh`
6. get the virtual machines ip address - `vagrant ssh-config | grep HostName | cut -d ' ' -f4`
6. To connect to Wordpress by pointing your browser to the ip addres/hostname

# Requirements
A machine running linux is required, use a virtual machine if needed.
You need ansible installed. Do "apt-get install ansible"

# Vagrant
Download and install vagrant in your OS from:
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
Download VirtualBox in your OS from:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/downloads
You can download vagrant box from:
https://atlas.hashicrop.com/boxes/search?provider-virtualbox
We choose: debian/jessie 64

# Install Vagrant Windows/Linux
Create a directory where you want to save your machine
	C:\mkdir debian-jessie.
	C:\cd debian-jessie
	C:\debian-jesse>

Execute vagrant in "C:\debian-jessie>"
	C:\debian-jessie>vagrant init
You will get a file called "Vagrantfile". Open it and change
	config.vm.box = "base"
to:
	config.vm.box = "debian/jessie64"
Alternative way -> if you type in:
	C:\debian-jessie>vagrant init debian/jessie64
It will create the "Vagrantfile" with config.vm.box = "debian/jessie64"
Note: The first time it will download the "box", might take some time.

Now we have debian/jessie64 in C:\debian-jessie>
	Run debian-jessie with "up"
		C:\debian-jessie>vagrant up
	We can check the status of our machine with "status"
		C:\debian-jessie>vagrant status
	Acces to the machine with:
		C:\debian-jessie>vagrant ssh

Create and copy keygen in debian-jessie with:
ssh-keygen

and

ssh-copy-id locanhost

Now try logging into the machine with:
ssh 'localhost

Make sure only the key(s) you wanted to be added.

# Forking and cloning the repository
Go to https://github.com/nicl0996/wordpress-ansible and press fork in the,
upper right corner. Login if needed.
Create a local clone from the formed repository using
"git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/wordpress-ansible".
Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your own github account username.

# Running the playbook
Go into the directory of the files, for example
"cd /home/jesper/wordpress-ansible
Edit the hosts file to either localhost or the ip address of the server,
(can be the machine you are working on) with "nano hosts"
Go to /etc/ansible and change the hostfile location in ansible.cfg to "/home/USER/wordpress-ansible",
sawp user with your own user name.
Generate public/private key pairs with "ssh-keygen". Press enter through all the steps.
Copy the public key from the localhost with "ssh-copy-id localhost". 
Replace IP-ADDRESS with your own ip.
Run it with ansible using "ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts -u USER -k"
Replace USER with your own user name

# Error solving
If you have sudo problems, make sure sudo is installed and add relevant users in /etc/sudoers.
Go into /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, uncomment ask_sudo_pass and set it to = Yes
